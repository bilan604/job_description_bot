# job_description_botnet | Web Scrapper & Crawler & DOS (Denial of Service) Attack
I do not finish projects like these because its sort of morally ambiguous. Do you see where I am conflicted on?

I chose to do it on Amazon, because I know they, like Youtube have obfuscation in place. I don't think it could really just be 80 lines of code to download all job description postings for all of Amazon.

But thats not the point. For these giant tech companies its a friendly game of cat and mouse, where I would for example, later down the line realize I need a VPN to continue webscrapping from different IPs, etc to get past their obfuscation, but I could do this for 99% of Companies in a day.
